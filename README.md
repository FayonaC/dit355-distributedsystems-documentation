### Assumptions
* Dentists will have lunch from 12:00-13:00
* Dentist will have their fika breaks from 15:00-15:30

### Design decisions
* Single-page web app front-end rather than a mobile-based front-end

### Architectural Styles
* Publish-Subscribe for the communication between the components

### How the Conceptual Design is Mapped Onto Implementation/Technologies
TBD 

#### Technologies
* Vue.js for frontend
* Bootstrap for frontend
* Java for backend
* Eclipse Paho
   * Java
   * JavaScript
* Eclipse Mosquitto
